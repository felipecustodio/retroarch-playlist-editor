RetroArch Playlist Editor interface tries to be as minimalist as possible and it's mostly self-explanatory.

**Import content button:** allows you to browse your files and add content to the current playlist (or just drag and drop them in the window). Alternatively, this button can also be used to open an existing .lpl playlist.

**Edit content button:** lets you edit massively the selected items (rename, set core, content path...)
